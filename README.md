Lumina is a full-stack web app that turns a user’s uploaded skin photo into an AI-driven skincare routine. It removes image metadata for privacy, analyzes the image with Google’s AI services, and then recommends a budget-aware set of products (cleanser/treatment/moisturizer) with an interactive dashboard and chatbot for follow-up questions.
